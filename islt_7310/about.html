           <h3>About Me</h3> 
           <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Ryan Woods</strong>, I am 22, and I am from Saint Charles, Missouri. I am in my final year at the University of Missouri and will graduate in May. I will graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. Also, I am graduating with the Cybersecurity, Info. Systems and Tech., and Media Tech. & Design certificates from Mizzou. 
            <br>While in the IT program I have found a liking to cybersecurity and the career field. I plan to go into the cybersecurity field after graduation in May. Through course work, various events, and student clubs I have been able to expand my knowledge in cybersecurity. I am currently in the Mizzou ‘Cyber Tigers’, cybersecurity, student organization, and ahve been since 2020. I have some good experience working with many computer languages, programs, and operating systems. 
            <br> <em>If you would like to contact me or read more, please check out my resume!</em></p>
