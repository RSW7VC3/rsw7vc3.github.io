            <h3>About the Site</h3>
            <p>Hello, welcome to my portfolio site! On this site, you will be able to learn more about me and my experience!</p>  
            <p>This website holds many different pages with lots of information about me. One of my
            goals for this website is for anyone viewing this site to be able to learn about my
            experience through the work/projects. These projects will have a breakdown of
            everything about them with documents and photos. Another goal for this website is for
            anyone viewing this site to know my skills and different competencies through the work I
            show and through my resume. Like many documents on the site, my resume will be as well.
            The last goal for this website is for anyone viewing this site to gain the knowledge of what
            my goals are for my career and who I am as a person. These will be on their page clearly
            described and give reason to as well. My main hope for this site is present myself and
            everything about me in the best way possible.
