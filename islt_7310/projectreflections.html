            <h3>Project Reflections</h3>
            <h4>SERS Mobile Application (Silent Emergency Response System) CAPSTONE PROJECT</h4>
            <p>The SERS application project was a very fun project to be a part of for my capstone project. From this project and the course, I was able to get a real-world feel and experience for working with a team of people from all different backgrounds, and a feel for real-world work with deadlines and documentation. I will always remember this project and it is one that I am very proud of.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Pfizer Internship Project/Presentation</h4>
            <p>This project was very interesting and eye-opening to me and with what I learned through the process of creating the event and all its parts. I gained a lot of good real-world experience in setting up and running an event in a work setting. This experience is and was my favorite when looking back at the experience, working with a team to coordinate, and set up an event of the size and nature was beyond rewarding.</p>
            <h4>Mizzou Web Design "Yelpification"</h4>
            <p>This project was a more difficult but fun one to complete. Here is this project I was able to learn how to fully make and launch my own website and do all this using an API. In completing this project, I gained a lot of knowledge in creating, handling, and managing a website. The knowledge I gained from this course and this project will be carried with me throughout my career.</p>
