    Hello! My name is Ryan Woods, and I am from Saint Charles, Missouri. I am a senior at the University of Missouri, and I am studying to get my degree in Information Technology with an emphasis in Cybersecurity. 
    I do have some prior experience in web application development from taking INFOTC 2830 â€“ Web Application Development 1, and when I took that course, I really enjoyed learning about the development of web pages. 
    My expectations for this course are to strengthen and build even more knowledge in web development from my prior experience. With this web development experience, I hope to use it in my future career or to have it if I want to go into web design. 
    My favorite hobby is just doing anything outside, I love the outdoors, but I do like to watch shows and movies, and play some video games. I am also really into sports, mainly just the NFL, NHL, and some MLB.
